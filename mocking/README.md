# Mocking

This example illustrates a step-by-step techinique for mocking dependencies.

Take a look at the sub-packages in order, starting with the source file, then the test files
if present.

Run the package with

```golang
go run github.com/jmileson/scratch/mocking
```

and run tests with

```golang
go test github.com/jmileson/scratch/mocking/...
```
